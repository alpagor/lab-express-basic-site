                    Naomi Klein was born in Montreal, Quebec, and brought up in a Jewish family with a history of peace
                    activism. Her parents were self-described "hippies" who emigrated from the United States in 1967 as
                    war
                    resisters to the Vietnam War.Her mother, documentary film-maker Bonnie Sherr Klein, is best known
                    for
                    her anti-pornography film Not a Love Story.Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of
                    Physicians for Social Responsibility. Her brother, Seth Klein, is director of the British Columbian
                    office of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.
                    Before World War II, her paternal grandparents were communists, but they began to turn against the
                    Soviet Union after the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact in 1939. In 1942, her grandfather, an animator at
                    Disney,
                    was fired after the 1941 strike,and had to switch to working in a shipyard instead. By 1956, they
                    had
                    abandoned communism. Klein's father grew up surrounded by ideas of social justice and racial
                    equality,
                    but found it "difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists", a so-called red diaper baby.
                    Klein's husband, Avi Lewis, was born into a well-connected political and journalistic family; he
                    works
                    as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker. The couple's only child, son Toma, was born on June
                    13,
                    2012.
